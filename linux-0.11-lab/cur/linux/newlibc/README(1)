Release Note
-------------------------------------------------------------------
This is the package of gcc 1.40 with 387 support and the libraries,
which include two math libraries, libm.a for with a 387 and libsoft.a
for without a 387, and a separate libtermcap.a taken from GNU's
tput 1.10.

This gcc supports 387. There are enough 387 emulations in 0.12
kernel to let gcc run without a 387. But libm.a definitely needs a 
387 for now. If you don't have a 387, use -lsoft instead of -lm.

GNU's binary utilities 1.9 are also included. They should be also used
instead of the old ones.

The buggy estdio is replaced by BSD stdio (non ANSI). The stdio used in
this package is from BSD 4.3, I think it's the one before networking
release. Make sure not to define USG stdio.

Some header files must be replaced by the ones included in this package.

The -mstring-insns option is no longer needed, which is added to the
old gcc for Linux and is not among the options for the standard gcc.

The -O option may fail when the INLINE functions (string.h) are passed 
as parameters. There is nothing wrong with compiler(?). They will be
fixed in gcc 2.0. You can change the source to avoid that.

They are some PRE_GCC_2. Please DOT NOT defines them. They are for
testing gcc 2.0 only.

Since there is no ptrace() in the 0.12 kernel. The -g option is
permanently disabled. It will be there in gcc 2.0. If you really need it,
please drop me a note. I just add a new cc1, called cc1.g, which
supports gdb. But it has not been tested.

I hope somebody will recompile all the binaries with this new gcc and
make them available for ftp. The new binaries should be smaller and
have less bugs.

The directory, crt, is used to make a crt0.o you like, although I
think the current one is quite reasonable.

When you use perror (), you may want to declare it first somewhere. The
current stdio.h doesn't declare it. It will find its place in some
header file when gcc 2.0 is released.

There is a new 387 math library which is better but has not been
tested. You can test it by replacing "math" with "mlinux" of DIRS in
Makefile. The hyperbolic functions may be not very accurate when x is
very small, like 1e-6. You will see what I mean. I don't think it will
cause much trouble.

INSTALL
---------------------------------------------------------------------

You only need to modify the top level Makefile to suit your system.
Make sure compiler and binary utilities are OK as well as header files.

You should have ../soft in your search path for header files.

You should only issue make at the top directory. Otherwise, some
variables may not be defined.

You can modify crt0.s to get the crt0.o you like.
