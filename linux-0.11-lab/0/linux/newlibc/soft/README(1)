I implemented frexp(), ldexp(), and modf()
as needed by this math library, using the IEEE double's of GNU CC
for the 68000.  This was previously implemented for the trix compiler
only (harmony stuff, in crt.a).

Now uses a sensible custom math.h instead of libm.h.

Added infnan() and finite() in const.c; these constants should be revised...

---------------------------------
I adopted this package to Linux. It works on all legal numbers. But it
needs more work to get error handling right.
